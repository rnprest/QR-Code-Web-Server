# QR code web server

## Description

This is just a quick copy/paste of a short go program included at the
bottom of [go.dev's effective_go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) page,
with an additional function added to open the web server in your browser
so that you don't have to manually go to that URL yourself.

All the program does is help you create QR codes using google's chart API.
